# Documentation Style Guide

This project uses [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html) to generate documentation pages from comments found in the source files. This guide focuses on writing compatible comments and ensuring consistency across the codebase.

To generate a doxygen manual for the project, ensure you have doxygen installed and then cd into the project root directory and run `doxygen`.

## Documenting Functions
For functions, a description of the function's purpose should go above the function:
```c
/// Creates a foo.
void foo(void);
```
Further considerations:
- Any comments inside the function should follow the usual `//` or `/**/` comment styles.
- For documenting return values, place a `@return` at the bottom of the function comment followed by the description of the return value. This should only be done if the name of the function is not self-explanatory and is well-understood.
- For documenting parameters, place a `@param` between the comment and the @return (if applicable) followed by the name of the parameter and a brief description. This should only be done if the name of the parameter is not self-explanatory and is well-understood.
- All `@param`s should come before `@return` and be in the same order the parameters appear in the function declaration. Note that this does not mean you should add empty `@params` for parameters deemed self-explanatory.

A full example would be as follows: (however in practice functions such as this would be considered self-explanatory)
```c
/// A cool function that multiplies a number by 2.
/// @param bar the input
/// @return bar multiplied by 2
s32 foo(s32 bar) {
    return 2*bar;
}
```

## Documenting EVT API Functions
Use `@evtapi` to mark functions as EVT API functions, and use `@param` to document the parameters as passed to `EVT_CALL`. Do not use `@return`. See [include/script_api/common.h](../include/script_api/common.h) for examples.

## Documenting Variables
Documentation of variables should include what this variable is used for if the name is not completely clear and if applicable whether a set of defines or enumerations should be used alongside it (which should be linked with `@see`, see below)
```c
/// My description of this variable.
s32 foo;
```

## Documenting Files
File documentation should go near the top of the file, below includes. It should only feature information that is general to the file.
```c
/// @file file_name.c
/// My description of this file.
```

##Â Documenting Fields
Struct fields can be documented in the same way as variables, but you may prefer to document them in an end-of-line comment instead.

## Other

### Documenting Bugs:
Bugs should be documented on the line above where the bug begins.
```c
/// @bug description
```
### Linking related information:
`@see` should be used to provide links to related information where appropriate, for example:
```c
/// Savefile data.
/// @see SaveContext
SaveContext gSaveContext;
```
In the case of functions, `@see` should come before the first `@param`.
### Markdown
You can use Markdown in your doc comments.
### LaTeX
You can embed [LaTeX](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) in your doc comments if useful to do so.

For inline rendering:
```c
/**
 * \f$ \textrm{Your LaTeX Here} \f$
 */
```
For centered rendering on a separate line:
```c
/**
 * \f[ \textrm{Your LaTeX Here} \f]
 */
```
