 * to the RDP *before* any RDP commands from the rdpCmds[] field. The
 * othermode is *always* sent.
 *
 * Stated another way, NONE of the gbi RDP othermode commands equivalent
 * to those listed here are allowed in the rdpCmd[] field of the 
 * gt state structure.
 *
 * Notice also that many of these commands do not make sense for
 * the turbo ucode (they control features not supported, like mip-mapping). 
 * They are only included here for completeness.
